OptiTrack
=========

Modified ROS Optitrack that uses NatNetSDK library and runs on windows against ROSINDIGO.DLL

Meant for Motiv 1.7.1 and natNet 2.7, runs on windows using windows libraries.  There is no linux working source for 
the new versions of motiv/natnet.

This is a working repo and not done yet.  Experimental stuff.  Be warned.
